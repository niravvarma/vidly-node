# vidly-node
Imaginary video rental nodejs application with express.js, MongoDB Atlas and deployment on Heroku

NOTE: This project was created by learning NodeJS tutorial from Mosh Hamedani - https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-complete-node-js-course
Original repository: https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/vidly-api-node

I did not forked the original repository because I have little different setup with some node modules (check package.json) and have used MongoDB Atlas (https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) rather than installing MongoDB in my mac machine (macOS Big Sur - verson Beta 11.0)
